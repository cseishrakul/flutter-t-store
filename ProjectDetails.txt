Flutter E-Commerce Porject:

Folder Part:
1. Lets Do Project Folder Structure.
2. Lets add some pre define file with code like app colors font size images.

Project Part:

// Splash Screen

1. Lets add splash screen in the project. For that lets create a yaml file in our main project folder. lets name it splash.yaml and have thos code on it:
flutter_native_splash:
  color: "#FFFFFF"
  color_dark: "#272727"
  image: assets/logos/t-store-splash-logo-black.png
  image_dark: assets/logos/t-store-splash-logo-white.png

  android_12:
    color: "#FFFFFF"
    color_dark: "#272727"
    image: assets/logos/t-store-splash-logo-black.png
    image_dark: assets/logos/t-store-splash-logo-white.png

  web: false

2. Lets add a dependency called flutter_native_splash: ^2.3.9 on pubspec.yaml
3. Lets run this code from our terminal so that we can see the splash screen:
        flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create --path=splash.yaml


// End Splash Screen

// Screen Onboarding

1. In app.dart inside scaffold as a home option lets have a onBoardingScreen().
2. Lets create onBoardingScreen stateless widget in lib>authentication>screen>onboarding>onboarding.dart
3. For using 2,3 image + content on scroll 1image + content lets have a package:
    smooth_page_indicator: ^1.1.0

4. For swiping screen lets use PageView widget and inside this lets have a OnBoardPage self made widget and inside this lets have our every screen image and content.
5. For skip this onboard screen lets have a widget after Pageview widget > OnBoardingSkip().
6. With the help of dot effect and next button we can swipe our onboard screen as well...for that lets use onBoardingDotNavigation() and OnBoardingNextButton() self made widget.
7. In those widget lets have stateless widget and put our styles there of all dot or next button.

8. For controlling all this widgets work lets have a controller inside features > authentication > controllers > onboarding > onboarding_controlelr.dart

9. Here we can make functions for controlling the work of every dot and next button and we can add those function on onPressed option of every widget.



// End Screen Onboarding
